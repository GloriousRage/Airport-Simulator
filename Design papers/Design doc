Airport Simulator - Design Doc

1. What is
2. Why is
3. How is (basic)
4. Notes(?)

1. This is an Airport Simulator - It has random plane generation of flights and landings, mapping of the moving planes
   in house, and GUI for the pretty colors.
2. To show of during interviews and stuff.
3. A BE server runs and on it the app runs. One is the airport itself, another is the flight generator that inputs
    incoming and outgoing flights by random instead of manual ones. And lastly there is an SQL DB to keep logs.
4. Dunno lol
